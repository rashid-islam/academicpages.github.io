# About Me
* I am a Ph.D. student in the [Information Systems Department](https://informationsystems.umbc.edu/) at [University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC)](https://www.umbc.edu/), advised by [Dr. James Foulds](http://jfoulds.informationsystems.umbc.edu/). I am also working as a research assistant in the [Foulds Research Group](http://jfoulds.informationsystems.umbc.edu/research_group.html) - The Latent Lab.
* My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning and artificial intelligence, particularly in the area of Fairness. My work is focused on building socially conscious and fair algorithms for machine learning, deep learning, recommender systems and natural language processing.     
* I was an intern in the wavelet development team at [MathWorks Inc.](https://www.mathworks.com/), Natick, MA in 2019. Before joining UMBC as a graduate student, I worked in [Huawei Technologies (Bangladesh) Ltd.](https://www.huawei.com/en/corporate-information/) as a Core Network Engineer. I received my Masterâ€™s Degree in Electrical Engineering at [University of Dhaka, Bangladesh](https://www.du.ac.bd/), supervised by Prof. [Zahid H.
